## The Problem I Solved

I was drowning in complexity. Every investment decision meant:
- Opening Yahoo Finance for prices
- Switching to a spreadsheet for calculations
- Googling "how to calculate Sharpe ratio" (again)
- Copy-pasting data between 5 different tools
- Second-guessing myself because I couldn't see the full picture

**The real cost wasn't time—it was confidence.** I never felt certain my analysis was complete.

## The Insight

What if instead of me becoming an expert in everything, I could have a *team* of experts who already knew my portfolio, my risk tolerance, and my goals?

Not a chatbot. Not an app. A **personal family office** that treats me like a wealth management client—but built on AI agents that can actually run calculations.

## What I Built

Finance Guru™ is my private AI-powered family office. It's not software you install—it's a system where Claude transforms into specialized financial agents who work exclusively for me.

**One command:**
```bash
/finance-orchestrator
```

**Eight specialists activate:**

| Agent | Expertise | What They Do |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **Cassandra Holt** | Orchestrator | Coordinates the team, routes my requests |
| **Market Researcher** | Intelligence | Scans markets, identifies opportunities |
| **Quant Analyst** | Data Science | Runs calculations, builds models |
| **Strategy Advisor** | Portfolio | Optimizes allocations, validates strategies |
| **Compliance Officer** | Risk | Checks position limits, flags concerns |
| **Margin Specialist** | Leverage | Analyzes margin strategies safely |
| **Dividend Specialist** | Income | Optimizes yield, tracks distributions |
| **Tax Optimizer** | Efficiency | Structures holdings for tax advantage |

## See It In Action

**Me:** "Should I add more TSLA to my portfolio?"

**What happens behind the scenes:**
```bash
# Market Researcher checks momentum
uv run python src/utils/momentum_cli.py TSLA --days 90

# Quant Analyst calculates risk metrics
uv run python src/analysis/risk_metrics_cli.py TSLA --days 90 --benchmark SPY

# Quant Analyst checks market-implied risk
uv run python src/analysis/itc_risk_cli.py TSLA --universe tradfi

# Strategy Advisor checks correlation with existing holdings
uv run python src/analysis/correlation_cli.py TSLA PLTR NVDA --days 90

# Compliance Officer validates position size
# → Checks if addition exceeds concentration limits
```

**What I get:** A coordinated answer that considers momentum, risk, correlation, and compliance—not just a single data point.

## The Technical Foundation

### 13 Production-Ready Analysis Tools

Every tool follows the same bulletproof pattern:

```
Pydantic Models → Calculator Classes → CLI Interfaces
     ↓                    ↓                  ↓
 Type Safety         Business Logic      Agent Access
```

| Category | Tools | Key Metrics |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Risk** | Risk Metrics, ITC Risk | VaR, CVaR, Sharpe, Sortino, Max Drawdown, Beta, Alpha |
| **Technical** | Momentum, Moving Averages, Volatility | RSI, MACD, Golden Cross, Bollinger Bands, ATR |
| **Portfolio** | Correlation, Optimizer, Backtester | Diversification score, Max Sharpe, Risk Parity |
| **Options** | Options Pricer | Black-Scholes, Greeks, Implied Volatility |
| **Hedging** | Total Return, Rolling Tracker, Hedge Sizer, Hedge Comparison | DRIP modeling, put roll alerts, contract sizing, SQQQ vs puts analysis |

### External Risk Intelligence

**ITC Risk Models API** integration provides market-implied risk scores:
- Real-time risk assessment for TSLA, AAPL, MSTR, NFLX, SP500, commodities
- Risk bands help agents validate entry/exit timing
- Complements internal quant metrics with external perspective

### Hedging & Portfolio Protection Toolkit

Four CLI tools for managing downside protection, built from real advisory sessions:

```bash
# Compare total returns across tickers (price + dividends + DRIP)
uv run python src/analysis/total_return_cli.py JEPI JEPQ QQQI --days 180

# Check put option positions and get roll suggestions
uv run python src/analysis/rolling_tracker_cli.py status
uv run python src/analysis/rolling_tracker_cli.py suggest-roll --dte-threshold 7

# Size hedge contracts based on portfolio value and monthly budget
uv run python src/analysis/hedge_sizer_cli.py --portfolio-value 200000 --budget 500

# Compare SQQQ inverse ETF vs protective puts for a market drop scenario
uv run python src/analysis/hedge_comparison_cli.py --drop-pct 20 --days 30
```

All hedging tools share 13 Pydantic models and read defaults from `user-profile.yaml` via the config loader.

## 🍴 Fork Model: Use Finance Guru Safely

Finance Guru is designed to be **forked** and used privately. Here's how it works:

### Architecture for Privacy

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/fork-model.png" alt="Finance Guru Fork Model" width="100%">
</p>

### How to Use

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Clone to your machine** (never commit personal data)
3. **Run onboarding** to generate your private configs
4. **Pull upstream updates** safely (configs in .gitignore)

### What's Tracked vs. Ignored

**Tracked (safe to commit):**
- ✅ Tools (`src/`, `scripts/`)
- ✅ Agent definitions (`fin-guru/agents/`)
- ✅ Templates (`scripts/onboarding/modules/templates/`)
- ✅ Documentation (`docs/`, `README.md`)
- ✅ Package files (`pyproject.toml`, `package.json`)

**Ignored (private data):**
- 🔒 `fin-guru/data/user-profile.yaml` (your financial data)
- 🔒 `notebooks/updates/*.csv` (your account exports)
- 🔒 `.env` (your API keys)
- 🔒 `fin-guru-private/` (your private strategies)

### Updating Your Fork

```bash
# Add upstream remote (one-time)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-AUTHOR/family-office.git

# Pull updates (safe - won't touch your private configs)
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main

# Your private data stays untouched
```

### Security Checklist

Before pushing to GitHub:

```bash
# Verify private files are ignored
git status --ignored

# Ensure no sensitive data in commit
git diff --cached

# Check .env is ignored
ls -la .env  # Should show file exists locally
git check-ignore .env  # Should output ".env" (confirmed ignored)
```

## Project Structure

└── justfile                  # Command launchpad (just --list)
```

## Why This Approach Works

**Traditional tools** give you data. Finance Guru gives you **judgment**.

The difference:
- A stock screener tells you RSI is 75
- Finance Guru tells you "RSI is overbought, but your portfolio is underweight tech, and Compliance says you have room for a small position if Quant's risk metrics confirm"

**It's the coordination that creates value**—not any single calculation.

## Security & Privacy

- All data stays local on my machine
- No external access to financial information
- Portfolio data never leaves this repository
- This is a private system, not a service

## Built With

- **Claude Code** - Multi-agent orchestration
- **Python 3.12** - Analysis engine
- **Pydantic** - Type-safe validation
- **yfinance** - Market data
- **pandas/numpy/scipy** - Calculations
- **ITC Risk Models** - External risk intelligence

## Context Management

Finance Guru is designed for **token efficiency**. Even with extensive startup context injection, you retain ample room for complex analysis.

### Typical Session Context Usage

| Component | Tokens | % of 200k |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| System prompt | 3.8k | 1.9% |
| System tools | 17.8k | 8.9% |
| MCP tools | 1.5k | 0.8% |
| Custom agents | 1.0k | 0.5% |
| Memory files (CLAUDE.md) | 2.5k | 1.2% |
| Skills | 3.6k | 1.8% |
| Messages | 22.2k | 11.1% |
| **Free space** | **103k** | **51.3%** |
| Autocompact buffer | 45.0k | 22.5% |

**Key insight**: With Finance Guru context auto-loaded at session start, you still have **51% free context** for actual work.

### Why This Works

1. **CLI-First Architecture**: Heavy computation happens in Python CLI tools, not in context. When you run `risk_metrics_cli.py`, the calculation happens outside the token window.

2. **Session Start Hooks**: The `load-fin-core-config.ts` hook injects:
   - System configuration
   - User profile with portfolio strategy
   - Latest Fidelity balances and positions
   - fin-core skill content

3. **Skills Auto-Activate**: Instead of loading all domain knowledge upfront, skills load on-demand based on your prompts and file paths.

4. **Structured Context**: YAML configs and markdown docs compress well and are easy for Claude to parse.

See [docs/reference/hooks.md](docs/reference/hooks.md) for details on the hooks system.
