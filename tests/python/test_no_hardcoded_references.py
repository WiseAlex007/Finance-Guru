Test: Verify No Hardcoded Personal Name References

This test ensures that Finance Guru has been properly genericized
and does not contain hardcoded personal name references that would
prevent distribution to other users.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Config files use template variables ({user_name}) instead of hardcoded names
- README and docs use placeholders for author name
- Only allowed locations: LICENSE, git history, migration specs
